# Database Migration Guide - Complete Vehicle Schema

## üö® Current Issue
Your database is missing the `body_type` column and many comprehensive NHTSA fields that we designed for the complete vehicle system.

## üìã Migration Steps

### Step 1: Backup Your Data (IMPORTANT!)
Before running the migration, backup your current data:

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Run this query to export your current vehicles:
```sql
SELECT * FROM vehicles;
```
4. Copy the results and save them in a text file

### Step 2: Run the Complete Migration

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the entire contents of `database/migrations/complete_vehicles_schema.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute the migration

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This will drop and recreate the vehicles table with the new schema**

### Step 3: Verify the Migration

Run this query to verify all columns are present:
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'vehicles' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
```

You should see all these columns:
- `id`, `vin`, `title`
- `make`, `model`, `year`, `trim`, `body_type`
- `price`, `original_price`, `condition`
- `mileage`, `fuel_type`, `transmission`
- `engine_type`, `engine_size`, `cylinders`, `horsepower`, `torque`
- `color`, `interior`, `doors`, `seats`
- All NHTSA safety fields (manufacturer, plant_city, etc.)
- All safety features (anti_brake_system, traction_control, etc.)
- Fuel efficiency and emissions data
- Dimensions and capacity data
- `location`, `status`, `images`, `features`, `description`
- `views`, `inquiries`, `is_featured`
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

### Step 4: Test the New Schema

The migration includes sample data with comprehensive NHTSA fields. Test by running:
```sql
SELECT 
  make, model, year, body_type, price, 
  manufacturer, plant_city, anti_brake_system,
  fuel_efficiency_combined, wheelbase, length
FROM vehicles 
LIMIT 3;
```

## üîß What's New in This Schema

### ‚úÖ Added Missing Fields
- `body_type` - Vehicle body type (SUV, Sedan, etc.)
- `title` - Vehicle title/name
- All NHTSA safety and technical specifications

### ‚úÖ Comprehensive NHTSA Integration
- **Manufacturing Data**: manufacturer, plant_city, plant_state, plant_country
- **Safety Features**: anti_brake_system, traction_control, stability_control
- **Advanced Driver Assistance**: adaptive_cruise_control, lane_departure_warning
- **Fuel & Emissions**: fuel_efficiency_city/highway/combined, co2_emissions
- **Dimensions**: wheelbase, length, width, height, curb_weight
- **Technical Specs**: engine_type, cylinders, horsepower, torque

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Performance
- Comprehensive indexing for all search fields
- Optimized queries for filtering and sorting
- Public view for available vehicles only

### ‚úÖ Better Data Management
- Proper constraints and validation
- Automatic timestamp updates
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Functions for incrementing views/inquiries

## üöÄ Next Steps After Migration

### 1. Update Your Application Code
The new TypeScript types are already created in `types/vehicle.ts`. Update your components to use the new `Vehicle` interface instead of the old `Car` interface.

### 2. Test Vehicle Addition
Try adding a new vehicle through your admin interface to ensure all fields work correctly.

### 3. Test NHTSA Integration
The vehicle extraction API should now populate all NHTSA fields when you enter a VIN.

### 4. Update Search/Filter Components
Your search and filter components can now use the new comprehensive fields for better filtering options.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If Migration Fails
1. Check if you have any foreign key constraints referencing the vehicles table
2. Drop those constraints first, then run the migration
3. Recreate the constraints after migration

### If Data is Lost
1. Restore from your backup
2. Run the migration again
3. Re-import your data with the new schema

### If Columns are Missing
1. Check the migration output for errors
2. Run the verification query to see what columns exist
3. Manually add missing columns if needed

## üìä Sample Data Included

The migration includes 3 sample vehicles with comprehensive NHTSA data:
- 2023 BMW X5 xDrive40i (Luxury SUV)
- 2024 Mercedes C-Class C 300 (Premium Sedan)  
- 2022 Toyota Camry XSE (Reliable Sedan)

Each includes full NHTSA specifications, safety features, and performance data.

## üîí Security & Permissions

The migration sets up:
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
- Admin full access policy
- Public read access for available vehicles
- Authenticated user read access
- Proper permissions for all user types

## üìà Performance Optimizations

The new schema includes:
- 15+ indexes for optimal query performance
- Composite indexes for common search patterns
- Optimized data types for each field
- Efficient storage for arrays and JSON data

**üéâ After completing this migration, your vehicle database will be production-ready with comprehensive NHTSA integration!**
